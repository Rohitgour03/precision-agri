# Precision Agri Sensing
This is a web application for precision agriculture sensing.
The app includes a login/logout feature and displays the soil mositure values collected from the soil moisture sensor over a period of time for each user. 

Further, have a LSTM soil moisture prediction model which has a separate interface (not integrated with the main app yet).
